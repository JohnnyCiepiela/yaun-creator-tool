Creator tool to extract tags from YouTube videos.

# Plan for the tool
I'll probably use React and TypeScript for the frontend, and it will be deployed on GitHub Pages.
For the backend, a good and free approach seems to be to use Node.js and deploy it via Netlify function.
There will also be PostgreSQL Neon connection to store some basic data.
